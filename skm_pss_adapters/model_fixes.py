'''
The models auto-generated from PSS have two major issues that leave parts of it disconnected. This occurs in the SBML, SBGN, and BoolNet models.

The issues are:
1) Genes and gene products occur in multiple forms, e.g.
      - "protein" form (e.g. unphosphorylated) as output from a translation reaction
      - "protein_active" form (e.g. phosphorylated) acting as a modifier in a downstream reaction.
   However, some are missing conversion reactions to connect the different forms
   (e.g. a protein activation reaction).
2) A number of nodes occur in multiple compartments as different species,
   but are missing transport reactions to connect them.


The following solutions are implemented:
1) We assume the unmodified protein form is the active form (i.e. no protein activation is required for the protein to be in the "active" form). To connect the model, we therefore change the output of translation reactions from "protein" to "protein_active", thus directly connecting them to downstream reactions where they act as the modifier. This is done by:
    a) Identify all nodes that occur as both "protein" and "protein_active" forms, and are not connected.
    b) For each of these nodes, identify all translation reactions that produce the "protein" form.
    c) Change the output of these translation reactions to the "protein_active" form.

2) For each species that occurs in multiple compartments, add transport reactions, from where the node is produced to where it is consumed. This is done by:
    a) Identify all nodes that occur in multiple compartments as different species, and are not connected.
    b) For each of these nodes, identify all compartments where it is produced (output from a reaction) and where it is consumed (input to a reaction).
    c) For each pair of compartments (from production to consumption), add a transport reaction if it does not already exist.
